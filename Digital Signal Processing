Continous: Define  each instant of time
Discrete: define particular instant of time only i.e. discontinous in time axis and continous in amplitude axis
Analog: both time and amplitude are continous
Digital : both time and amplitude are dis-continous

Analog----> Sampler >>>>> Discrete ------> Quantizer --------> Encoder>>>>>>>>>> Digital
Convolution is a mathematical operation which is used to expressed the i|p and o|p relationship in LTI system.
Fourier Series: To represent any point/vector in space we require base co-ordinate x,y,z vector, In same case to represent any general signal we require base signal set. 
Eg: sinwt, coswt, sinusoidal exponential,(orthogonality is must)


Distortionless System:
Constant magnitude response and linear phase response.
Bandwith for distortionless system is infinite.

Bandwidth: Width of group of frequencies for which magnitude response of an LTI system is non-zero.
