# Hypothesis: 
1. Every object has a natural frequency. It is subject to vibrate through a extrnal source vibration and if this external vibration closely matches to object's natural frequncy then maximum energy generated/dissipiated. So every human has a natural frequency of listening and speaking. If a person love/hate to listen someone's voice/speech (their pitch, rhythm, stress, loudness, articulation, formants) means the speaker's natural frequncy matches/doesn't matches with listner's natural frequency i.e. resonance occurs and vice versa. So if we can get the natural freq. of unknown person then we can create the resonance. (Application: Recommendation, Voice Assistance, Mood Enhancer, Make happy, stressfree). We can ask him to interact with assistant and collect the user voice to calculate his natural frequency.
eg: Talking with loveone, Songs, Motivation Speakers 
2. Research on deaf and dump to make the better assistive device.
3. Estimation of environmental sound's formant frequencies.
4. Predecting illness through voice.
